        Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities, and grow
        businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other products, features, apps,
        services, technologies, and software we offer (the Meta Products or Products), except where we expressly state
        that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don{"`"}t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we
        state otherwise. Instead, businesses and organizations, and other persons pay us to show you ads for their
        products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant
        to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalized ads to show you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don{"`"}t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don{"`"}t share information that directly identifies
        you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific
        permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we
        show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of
        their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn
        more about how personalized advertising under these terms works on the Meta Products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and
        provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings pages of the relevant Meta
        Product at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.
